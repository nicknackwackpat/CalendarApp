# CalendarApp

For the homework assignment I created a simple and easily accessible calendar app used to record, save and store user generated events throughout the day. In order to enter a new event, the user is required to type the event into the timeblock. Upon hitting the 'Save' button, the newly generated event is then saved to the local storage.
